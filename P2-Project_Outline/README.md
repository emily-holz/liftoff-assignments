# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. 
This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction 
and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of 
the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Do you ever want to discuss your favorite music? Nerd out with fans just like yourself? Share and/or 
read about different song lyrics, artists, styles, and possibly discover new music?

Traditional music streaming applications don't really have the space for discussion. Our goal 
with this application will allow users a space to communicate with others about music! In the style 
of a traditional forum, users will be able to make posts and view threads of discussion about music. 

### Features
User login: Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the application. They will have a profile which
will display their post history.
Make a Post: Users will be able to create a post which other users may then comment on continuing a thread
of discussion
Comment on a post: Users will be able to interact with other users and discuss by replying to or reacting to 
posts with comments, creating a thread of discussion
Categories/Sections: Threads will be sorted into different categories possibly based on most activity for users
to explore existing discussions to join. 

### Technologies
Java
Spring Boot
MySQL
Hibernate
Thymeleaf templates

### What I'll Have to Learn
I will have to really dive back into the topics learned at the end of LC101, specifically working with Object 
Relational Mapping. Additionally, I will need to learn more about authentication and the specific technologies
in order to authenticate users.
